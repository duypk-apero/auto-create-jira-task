# Analysis
1. Current Epics in AIP187 project:
   - AIP187-26: Billing
   - AIP187-25: General (to be excluded as per requirement)
   - AIP187-24: Tutorial SDK

2. Required Actions:
   - Need to check spreadsheet data for new Epics
   - Skip creation of "General" Epic as requested
   - For existing Epics (Billing, Tutorial SDK), update metadata if needed
   - Create new Epics for any remaining unique Epic names from spreadsheet

# Proposed Solution
1. Data Processing:
   - Extract unique Epic names from spreadsheet
   - For each Epic (excluding "General"):
     * Collect associated tasks
     * Determine highest priority
     * Find earliest start date and latest due date
     * Generate description from tasks
     * Identify common assignee and version

2. Epic Creation/Update Process:
   a. For each unique Epic:
      - If Epic exists (Billing, Tutorial SDK):
        * Update metadata if different
        * Update description if needed
      - If Epic doesn't exist:
        * Create new Epic with collected metadata
        * Verify creation was successful
   
   b. For each created/updated Epic:
      - Record Epic key for future task linking
      - Verify all metadata is correct

3. Validation:
   - Confirm all required Epics are created/updated
   - Ensure no duplicate Epics were created
   - Verify all metadata is correctly set
