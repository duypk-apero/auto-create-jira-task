### Jira Epic Creation from Spreadsheet  

Create Jira Epics in the **[AIP187 project](https://apero.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/AIP187/boards/119/backlog)** using data from the spreadsheet:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WKkz_ZfneQs7IzWFFFWTpnBV4q34musyKsi96NCb4vg/edit?usp=sharing

---

#### Step 1: Data Extraction  
Extract unique Epic names from the spreadsheet's "Epic" column and map data as follows:  
- **Epic** → Epic name/summary  
- **Priority** → Extract highest priority among tasks within the Epic  
- **Start Date** → Earliest start date of any task in the Epic  
- **Due Date** → Latest due date of any task in the Epic  
- **Description** → Generated description summarizing the Epic's purpose and main features
- **Assignee** → Assignee (if present)
- **Version** → Version (if present, from most common version in Epic's tasks)

#### Step 2: Epic Creation Process
For each unique **Epic** value:  

1. **Check for existing Epic first**:  
```
search_issues(
    jql="project=project_key AND issuetype=Epic AND summary~'[Epic column value]'"
)
```

2. **Create a Task issue if no duplicate exists**:  
```
create_issue(
    project_key=project_key,
    summary="[Epic column value]",
    issue_type="Task",
    description="[Generated description]",
    priority="[Highest priority from tasks]",
    duedate="[Latest due date from tasks]"
)
```
   
3. **Convert Task to Epic**:  
```
update_issue(
    issue_key="[Task key from step 2]",
    fields={"issuetype": {"name": "Epic"}}
)
```

4. **Verify creation was successful**:
```
get_issue(
    issue_key="[Epic key from step 3]"
)
```

#### Step 3: After Creation
- Record the mapping between Epic names and their Jira Epic keys for use in Task creation
- Verify all Epics were created correctly with appropriate relationships

**IMPORTANT:**
- Always check for existing Epics before creating new ones to avoid duplicates
- Generate meaningful descriptions that summarize the Epic's purpose based on its tasks
- Use date ranges to set appropriate timeframes for each Epic
- Include all metadata like version, assignee, and priority when available
